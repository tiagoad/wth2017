_The Machine_ can tell if you're a good coder. 

## What is this?

Using the GitHub API, _The Machine_ can tell if you're a good coder, and why.
  
She can be used to compare job candidates, to find good coders, or to brag about your score in your twitter profile. 

* _She_ knows if you're following conventions and good practice
* _She_ finds vulnerabilities in your code
* _She_ knows if your code is being tested, and to what extent
* _She_ can tell what technology you like the most, and how you use it
* _She_ knows if commit properly
* _She_ **knows** if you use tabs or spaces
* _She_ knows everything about your code.
